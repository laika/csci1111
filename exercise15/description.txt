Exercise #15:
------------
- Modify the example sort1.c to store and
  sort an array floating-point values. Then
  modify it to sort into ascending order.
  Generate the values to be sorted using
  rand( ).

  Notes:
    - Do it in careful, minimal steps:
      - Steps:
        - convert the data to be sorted to
          floating-point
        - change the sort order to
          ascending
        - figure out how to generate a
          random sequence of floating-point
          values using rand()
    - Not all data and variables will need to change,
      counts and indexes are integers regardless of
      the type of data in the array
    - If you get stuck, retreat to the original
      example and try the part that is causing you
      trouble, or just start over.
