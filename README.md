# Assignments and Exercises from CSCI 1111
This repository is a collection of assignments and exercises (labs) from the
CSCI 1111 class I am taking.

Everything in the `.c` and `.h` files along with the Makefiles were written by
me.

## Where's Assignments 1 & 2 and Exercise 1?
Those were are extremely simple and contained a lot of personal information.
There's no need for them to be available in this repository.
