Exercise #7:
------------
- Write a program that reads the length and width of a
  rectangle, and then computes the area of the rectangle.
  Print a label/message that identifies it as the area
  of a rectangle, or as the area of a square (if the
  length and width are equal.)
  {Note: Remember the difference between equality '=='
         and assignment '='.
         - See what happens if you use '=' instead of
           '=='.
         - Use -Wall to see that the compiler warns you
           when using '=' in a boolean/test context.   }
