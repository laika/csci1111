Assignment 3:                Given: 08/31/17     Due: 09/08/17
------------                                  Points: 10
Purpose: Do some computations.

Description:

Create a C program that reads in three integer values
representing the height, depth and width of a rectangular
prism/box/cube. Compute the following results using those three
values:

        Areas:
          - Surface area of the top
          - Surface area of the front face
          - Surface area of an end
          - Surface area of the entire prism

        Perimeters:
          - of the bottom
          - of the front face
          - of an end

        Volume:
          - of the prism

        Chord:
          - diagonal distance across the prism. That is: the
            single chord that crosses the prism from
            left-to-right, top-to-bottom, and front-to-back.

Notes:
-----
- Before coding:
  - Be sure you understand the problem
  - Draw a picture and label it
  - Figure out the formulas/computations for each of the
    values to be computed
  - Create an "answer key" with at least three different sets
    of input values, and the correct solutions, that you can
    use to verify that your program is working properly
- Read the three integer input values in the order they were
  first mentioned above: height, depth, width.
- Print the results in the order listed above.

- Do as much integer math as possible. (Since the inputs are
  integers, almost all the results will also be integers.)

- Nicely format and label your output.

- Gradually develop your program in steps:
    - Read in your inputs and print them out to confirm
      you are reading them in correctly
    - Compute just one of the computed values
    - Use your "answer key" to check your work
    - Add additional computations one at a time
    - Use your "answer key" to check your work
    - Ask about any of the math you are not sure of
