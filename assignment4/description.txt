Assignment 4:                Given: 09/28/17     Due: 10/06/17
------------                                  Points: 10
Purpose: Use loops, rand( ) and do some analysis of the
         randomness of rand( ).

Description:

  Write a program that will simulate the following random
  events using the rand( ) function in the C standard
  libraries. We are interested in determining if rand( )
  really seems to produce a random set of values. To do this
  we will repeat the event a certain number of times and see
  how often we get each of the possible results. If rand( )
  is truly random, and our mapping to the possible results is
  uniform, our results should be equally likely and therefore
  evenly distributed across all possible results.

  The two events will be:
      1) Flipping a coin
      2) Rolling a six-sided die

  Repeat each event:
        1) 10
        2) 100
        3) 1000
        4) 10,000
        5) 100,000  times

  Within each set of repetitions, count how often each result
  occurs. Then compute the percentage of the total events
  were represented by each result.

  Ex:
    Coin:
    ----
      Flips: 10       Heads: 40%
                      Tails: 60%

    Die:
    ----
      Rolls: 10       1: 10%
                      2:  0%
                      3: 20%
                      4: 30%
                      5: 30%
                      6: 10%

              ...

    Coin:
    ----
      Flips: 100000   Heads: 49%
                      Tails: 51%

    Die:
    ----
      Rolls: 100000   1: 17%
                      2: 18%
                      3: 17%
                      4: 17%
                      5: 17%
                      6: 16%



  Notes:
  -----
  - Do not "randomly" seed the rand( ) function, we are
    interested in repeatability.
  - No inputs are necessary.
  - Gradually develop your program in steps

  - There is a "Supplement" posted on Otto that discusses
    the rand( ) function and there are "Random_.c examples
    in the examples directory.
