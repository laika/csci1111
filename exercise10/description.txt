Exercise #10:
------------
Modify the cards2.c program to print the
suit and the face value for each card that is displayed.

Notes:
       - The cards2.c already indicates a suit and a
         unique value for each card
       - Look at Cards3.c and Cards4.c to see the
         type of output we are looking for (No face
         values are displayed.)
       - You should be able to write a little bit
         of code of your own for cards2.c to print
         like cards3 and cards4, and also print the
         face value; without doing exactly what cards3
         and cards4 do.

         Hint: Use some conditional statements
